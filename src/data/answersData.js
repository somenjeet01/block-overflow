      content: `The beauty of dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is its simplicity and consistency, especially during volatile markets. Research has consistently shown that for most retail investors, maintaining a consistent schedule regardless of market conditions produces better long-term results than trying to time contributions.
  
  That said, if you have additional funds available beyond your regular $500, you might consider setting aside a small "opportunity fund" that you can deploy during significant market corrections (10%+ drops). This approach gives you the psychological benefit of taking advantage of dips while maintaining the disciplined core of your DCA strategy.
  
  For your asset allocation, since you're in your early 30s, your 90/10 split between equities and bonds is reasonable. However, you might consider increasing your international exposure slightly to 25-30% of your equity portion for better diversification, especially given current global market valuations.`,

      content: `I've been using DCA for over a decade, and I've found that the psychological benefits of staying consistent are just as important as the financial ones. When you try to time contributions, you introduce emotion into the equation, which rarely works out well.
  
  One approach I've used successfully is to increase my contribution percentage slightly during downturns, rather than changing the timing. For example, if you normally contribute 10% of your income, perhaps bump it to 12% during significant market dips. This way, you're still following the core DCA philosophy while taking moderate advantage of lower prices.`,

      content: `From a behavioral finance perspective, the main advantage of DCA is removing emotion from the equation. When investors try to time the market, they often end up buying high and selling low due to behavioral biases like recency bias and loss aversion.
  
  If market volatility makes you uneasy, consider using an auto-investing feature that invests smaller amounts more frequently (weekly instead of monthly). This provides more averaging points and can help reduce the impact of volatility on your psychology.
  
  Regarding your allocation, at your age, 10% in bonds is reasonable, though you could potentially go as low as 5% if you have strong job security and won't need to access the funds for 20+ years.`,
